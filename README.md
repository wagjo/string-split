# Various ways to split a string in Clojure

* everything implemented as both reducible
  and foldable collection
  * except variants using lazy seqs
  * reducer variants support early termination e.g. with r/take
* most variants have limits on what is a delimiter, or
  how the result will look like
  * in return they deliver better performance
* two categories
  * partition-by on a collection of characters
  * splitting a string

## partition-by on collection of characters

* supports infinite collections
* does not need whole string in memory at once
* supports any predicate fn
* small memory usage

### lazy-seqs

* very slow, should not be used ever

TODO

### naive iterative reducer/folder

* slow but straightforward

TODO

### mutable iterative reducer/folder

* fastest flexible variant

TODO

## split on string

* very fast because we have all data in memory
* larger memory usage
* often strips delimiters from the result
  * some variants return empty strings for subsequent delimiters
  * depends on use case whether this is good or not
* less flexible, each approach has its own limits on delimiters
  or at the returned result

### regex reducer/folder

* any regex, may return empty strings

TODO

### StringTokenizer reducer/folder

* set of delimiting chars

TODO

### optimized iterative reducer/folder

* like flexible partition-by, but optimized for strings

TODO
  
### indexOf reducer/folder

* THE fastest reducer/folder, but has specific limitations
  * delimiter is one character, or string (not implemented yet)
  * does not keep delimiters (whitespace chunks) in the result

```clojure  
;; benchmark reducer
(time (count (into [] (siof/split \space text))))
(with-progress-reporting
  (bench (into [] (siof/split \space text)) :verbose))
;; benchmark folder
(time (count (into [] (foldit (siof/split \space text)))))
(with-progress-reporting
  (bench (into [] (foldit (siof/split \space text))) :verbose))
;; Reducer time: 72.141531 ms
;; Folder time: 33.634083 ms
