# to split a string in a Clojure

This project demonstrates various ways to split a string in a Clojure. When choosing a particular variant, do not forget to check the requirements on the inputs:

* some variants work with collection of characters and support 
  on the fly processing and infinite collections, some work only 
  on strings already loaded in the memory.
* do determine when to split a string, some variants take ordinary
  function, some just allows to specify char or set of chars on
  which to split
* some variants cannot return 'whitespace chunks', which may
  be required in some cases.

Similarly, when comparing which variant is better, consider following 
aspects:

* how much time it takes to produce a result. This is easily 
  measured with clojure.core/time or criterium benchmarking library
* how much memory will be allocated for the result. This can be 
  analyzed through any JVM profiler.
* how many garbage (temporary objects) is created while computing
  result. This is a creepy performance hit, which can be analyzed
  with commercial JVM profilers, e.g. JProfiler.

More notes:

* everything implemented as both reducible
  and foldable collection
  * except variants using lazy seqs
  * reducer variants support early termination e.g. with r/take
* most variants have limits on what is a delimiter, or
  how the result will look like
  * in return they deliver better performance
* two categories
  * partition-by on a collection of characters
  * splitting a string

## partition-by on collection of characters

* supports infinite collections
* does not need whole string in memory at once
* supports any predicate fn
* small memory usage

### lazy-seqs

* see [wagjo.split.algo.lazy](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/lazy.clj)
* very slow, should not be used, ever
* very high memory use, large amount of garbage
* easy technique, easy to reason about
* no parallel variant
* can keep whitespace chunks in the result
* `Reducer time: 3200 ms (4200 ms if keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: N/A`

### naive iterative reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.partitionby-naive](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/partitionby_naive.clj)
* slow but straightforward
* high memory use
* lot of garbage when folding, because of result wrapping
* parallel variant is actually slower, caused by wrapping 
  intermediate values in a map and producing huge amount of garbage.
* serves as a good base for understanding how things work 
  before we get to the optimized variant
* very flexible, can specify how to reduce/fold individual values 
  to create partitions
* `Reducer time: 1550 ms (2450 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 2500 ms (4000 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`

### mutable iterative reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.partitionby](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/partitionby.clj)
* faster flexible variant
  * uses mutation for intermediate results to lower the garbage
* little garbage
* very flexible, can specify how to reduce/fold individual values 
  to create partitions
* parallel variant really shines
* `Reducer time: 575 ms (866 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 213 ms (849 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
  * slow performance when keeping whitespace chunks may be because benchmarking hits current JVM memory limit?

### mutable iterative reducer/folder with shifting folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.partitionby-shift](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/partitionby_shift.clj)
* fastest flexible variant
* avoids chunk/segment minigame when folding by providing custom folding function
* works only on collections which support random access
  * not much faster but the implementation is significantly simpler
* `Reducer time: same as previous`
* `Folder time: 189 ms (811 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`

## split on string

* very fast because we have all data in memory
* larger memory usage
* often strips delimiters from the result
  * some variants return empty strings for subsequent delimiters
  * depends on use case whether this is good or not
* less flexible, each approach has its own limits on delimiters
  or at the returned result

### regex reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.regex](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/regex.clj)
* any regex, uses matcher so that we support early termination of reduce
* fast, but keep in mind that you are using a cannon to shoot mosquitoes
* `Reducer time: 296 ms (445 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 84 ms (123 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`

### StringTokenizer reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.tokenizer](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/tokenizer.clj)
* takes set of delimiting chars
* fast, but StringTokenizer is deprecated in java
* `Reducer time: 134 ms (293 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 71 ms (120 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`

### optimized iterative reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.partitionby-string](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/partitionby_string.clj)
* like flexible partition-by, but optimized for strings
* `Reducer time: 225 ms (213 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 54 ms (71 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* special variant which produces String-like objects which implements
  CharSequence and shares underlaying data with source string
* `Reducer time: 161 ms (140 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 42 ms (56 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
  
### indexOf reducer/folder

* see [wagjo.split.algo.lazy](https://github.com/wagjo/string-split/blob/master/src/clj/wagjo/split/algo/indexof.clj)
* THE fastest reducer/folder, but has specific limitations
  * delimiter is one character, or string (not implemented yet)
  * does not keep delimiters (whitespace chunks) in the result
* lowest memory use and almost no garbage (a tiny bit when folding)
* `Reducer time: 80 ms (136 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 37 ms (71 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* special variant which produces String-like objects which implements
  CharSequence and shares underlaying data with source string
* `Reducer time: 52 ms (79 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
* `Folder time: 27 ms (54 ms when keeping whitespace chunks)`
